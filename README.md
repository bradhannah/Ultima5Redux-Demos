# Ultima5Redux-Demos
The following repository contains pre-alpha builds of the Ultima 5 Redux project. 

# Instructions
DO NOT IGNORE THESE OR YOU WILL HAVE A BAD TIME!

1. You must first have a copy of the original Ultima 5 game data and an existing save game

2. Copy the ultima5 directory to <br>
Windows -> `C:\games\Ultima_5\`<br>
MacOS -> `/tmp/u5` or `/games/u5` <br>
You are able to put may Ultima 5 directories in these directory - you will be permitted to choose when launching the game
For example my personal directory looks like <br>
-> `C:\games\Ultima_5\gold\*`<br>
-> `C:\games\Ultima_5\britain\*`<br>
-> `C:\games\Ultima_5\im_scared\*`<br>
I know this is kind of silly, but I just haven't gotten around to adding the option to choose your own base directory.

3. Download the package
