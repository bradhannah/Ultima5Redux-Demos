# Ultima5Redux-Demos
The following repository contains pre-alpha builds of the Ultima 5 Redux project. 

# Instructions
DO NOT IGNORE THESE OR YOU WILL HAVE A BAD TIME!

1. You must first have a copy of the original Ultima 5 game data and an existing save game

2. Copy the ultima5 directory to <br>
Windows -> `C:\games\Ultima_5\`<br>
MacOS -> `/tmp/u5` or `/games/u5` <br>
You are able to put may Ultima 5 directories in these directory - you will be permitted to choose when launching the game
For example my personal directory looks like <br>
-> `C:\games\Ultima_5\gold\*`<br>
-> `C:\games\Ultima_5\britain\*`<br>
-> `C:\games\Ultima_5\im_scared\*`<br>
I know this is kind of silly, but I just haven't gotten around to adding the option to choose your own base directory.

3. Download the package from here: https://github.com/bradhannah/Ultima5Redux-Demos/tree/master/Feb-24-2020 for your appropriate operating system

4. Unzip the game into whatever directory you see fit

4.5 IF you are MacOS then will need to do the following:
`chmod +x Ultima5Redux-MacOSX-Feb-24-2020.app/Contents/MacOS/*` - also you need to hold down CTRL and right click the app and click open since it is not a trusted app.

5a. Windows -> Run `Ultima5Redux3D` 
5b. MacOSX -> Run `Ultima5Redux-MacOSX-Feb-24-2020.app`

6. When the loading screen opens be sure to choose `Select Save Game`. You should see the Ultima 5 directories you have dropped onto the disk in step 2. Choose one and click `Load`

7. Choose `Journey Onward`

8. The "game" should start up from the save data provided. 

9. You will notice a few things
* There is an annoying text box (debug console). Simply press `C` to toggle it
* It may have crashes or not worked in some way or another. Curious - but not suprising, I haven't tested this on any other machines yet. Let me know if you had a problem - but I can't be certain I can help. But I'll try.

10. Have fun and play around! There is a `D`ebug menu you can use to teleport and monkey around. There is no save feature, so it's safe and won't harm your save file.

If you're keen to submit a feature request, bug, issue or whatever please use the Issue tracker found here: https://github.com/bradhannah/Ultima5Redux/issues

Good luck!
